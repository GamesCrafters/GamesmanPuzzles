# Tests
This is where we would be testing our solvers on the games we develop. Ideally, there should be a test for every game and a solver should have at least one game to be tested on.
### Current tests
* testHanoi.py: Basic Hanoi test.
* testPickleWrapper.py: Test for the PickleWrapperSolver
* testPuzzleTutorial.py: Test for the puzzle tutorial
* testSolverTutorial.py: Test for the solver tutorial
* testGeneralSolver.py: Test for GeneralSolver
* testGraphPuzzle.py: Test for GraphPuzzle
### If you want to test manually:
Go to the base directory and execute. You have to have pytest installed.
```
pytest tests/[name_of_test.py]
```
