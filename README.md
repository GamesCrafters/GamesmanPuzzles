[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/GamesCrafters/GamesmanPuzzles/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/GamesCrafters/GamesmanPuzzles)

A collection of Puzzles bundled together in a simple yet powerful Python interface. Developed as of part of the [UC Berkeley GamesCrafters.](http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu/)

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the dependencies (it's recommended to use a virtualenv when installing dependencies of any project):
```
git clone https://github.com/GamesCrafters/GamesmanPuzzles.git
cd GamesmanPuzzles
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

To get optional closed-form solver for Lights Out, run the following commands from the project's root directory:
```
cd puzzlesolver/extern
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Run from the base directory of the repository
```
cd puzzlesolver/players
python tui.py hanoi
```
to play a puzzle of Towers of Hanoi.

## Solving Puzzles
You can solve all the puzzles by running the following in the base project directory:
```
python -m scripts.solve
```

## Serving Puzzles

Run from the base directory of the respository
```
python -m scripts.server
```
to access the webserver locally. The server should be running at http://127.0.0.1:9001/.


### Routes

- `/<puzzle_id>/<variant_id>/start/` 
  - Returns the initial position of the variant of ID `variant_id` of the puzzle of ID `puzzle_id`. If the puzzle supports randomized starting positions, the content of the response will correspond to a random initial position.

    The response contains two fields:
      - `position`: (String) The human-readable string representation of the position.
      - `autoguiPosition`: (String) The AutoGUI-formatted string corresponding to the position, which tells the frontend application how to render the position.

    Below is an example response for `/npuzzle/3/start/` which gives a starting position for the variant with `variant_id` "3" of the puzzle with `puzzle_id` "npuzzle" (i.e., the 8-Puzzle variant of the Sliding Number Puzzle).

    ```json
    {
        "position": "7-2453681",
        "autoguiPosition": "1_7-2453681"
    }
    ```

    Since the Sliding Number Puzzle supports randomized starting positions, this response is randomized. Below is another example response for `/npuzzle/3/start/`.

    ```json
    {
        "position": "62-581374",
        "autoguiPosition": "1_62-581374"
    }
    ```

- `/<puzzle_id>/<variant_id>/positions/?p=<position_string>`
  - Returns information about the position specified by `position_string` of the variant specified by `variant_id` of the game specified by `game_id`. This is used, for example, by GamesmanUni when it needs to load a new position every time a user makes a move.

    When using this route to get information about a position, `position_string` should be the human-readable string representation of the position, and NOT the AutoGUI-formatted position string corresponding to that position.

    The response contains the following fields:
      - `position`: (String) The human-readable string representation of the puzzle position.
      - `autoguiPosition`: (String) The AutoGUI-formatted string corresponding to the position, which tells the frontend application how to render the position.
      - `positionValue`: (String) The value of this position. This field will either be `win` (the puzzle is solvable from this position) or `lose` (the puzzle cannot be solved from this position).
      - `remoteness`: (Number, may be undefined) If `positionValue` is `win`, i.e., the puzzle is solvable from this position, then this is a non-negative integer indicating the number of moves needed to solve the puzzle from this position. If `positionValue` is `lose`, i.e., the puzzle cannot be solved from this position, then this field is undefined.
      - `moves`: (Array): A list of move objects, in no particular order. If there are no legal moves from this position, this is an empty array. Each move object contains the following fields:
        - `move`: (String) The human-readable string representation of the move.
        - `autoguiMove`: (String) An AutoGUI-formatted move string, which tells the frontend application how to render the button that the user can click to make this move.
        - `position`, `autoguiPosition`, `positionValue`, `remoteness` of the child position reached after making this move.
    
    Below is the response for position `-87125364` of the 8-Puzzle variant (`variant_id` of "3") of the Sliding Number Puzzle (`puzzle_id` of "npuzzle"), i.e., the response for `/npuzzle/3/positions/?p=-87125364`. The puzzle can be solved in as few as 28 moves and both legal moves make progress toward the solved state.

    ```json
    {
        "position": "-87125364", 
        "autoguiPosition": "1_-87125364",
        "positionValue": "win",
        "remoteness": 28,
        "moves": [
            {
                "autoguiMove": "M_1_0_x",
                "autoguiPosition": "1_8-7125364",
                "move": "8",
                "position": "8-7125364",
                "positionValue": "win",
                "remoteness": 27
            },
            {
                "autoguiMove": "M_3_0_x",
                "autoguiPosition": "1_187-25364",
                "move": "1",
                "position": "187-25364",
                "positionValue": "win",
                "remoteness": 27
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

## Testing (Broken)
To run all the tests, run the following command:
```
pytest --cov puzzlesolver
```
