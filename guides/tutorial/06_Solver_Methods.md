# The Solver Function

Our GeneralSolver uses a bottom to top BFS algorithm to classify positions of the puzzle. This guide assumes that you have checked out the following documentation for a [puzzle tree.](https://nyc.cs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Puzzle_tree)

### Introduction
The `solve` function is the core of all solvers in the GamesmanPuzzles and is used to classify positions of the puzzle. For this solver, we will use memoization and tree traversal.

Our GeneralSolver traverses the puzzle tree using the solve function. First, start with the function initalization:
```python
def solve(self, puzzle, **kwargs):
```

Remember back in the puzzle project, we defined a few important functions that were meant to be used for this solver. These functions are:
- ```generateSolutions(self, **kwargs):``` Generates all the positions that have a primitive value of SOLVABLE.
- ```generateMoves(self, **kwargs):``` Generates moves from that position.
- ```doMove(self, move, **kwargs):``` Returns a new Puzzle object with ```move``` executed. 

Following the steps of the algorithm we defined in [puzzle tree:](https://nyc.cs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Puzzle_tree)

1. Find all the winstates of a Puzzle and set their remoteness to be 0.
2. Generate all positions that have a move towards the initial positions in step 1.
3. Set all of our generated positions to have a remoteness equal to the initial position plus 1 if the position was not seen before.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all new generated positions.

Splitting the algorithm into two separate parts:

Step 1: Initializations of the winstates (solutions) of the puzzle as well as setting their remotenesses to 0. Additionally also initalizing the Queue data structure used for BFS.
```python
def solve(self, **kwargs):
    solutions, queue = self.puzzle.generateSolutions(), q.Queue()
    for solution in solutions: 
        self.remoteness[hash(solution)] = 0
        queue.put(solution)
```

Step 2, 3, & 4: The following performs the BFS portion of the algorithm. 
```python
    # BFS for remoteness classification                        
    while not queue.empty():
        puzzle = queue.get()
        for move in puzzle.generateMoves('undo'):
            nextPuzzle = puzzle.doMove(move)
            if hash(nextPuzzle) not in self.remoteness:
                self.remoteness[hash(nextPuzzle)] = self.remoteness[hash(puzzle)] + 1
                queue.put(nextPuzzle)
```

The final solve function should look like this:
```python
def solve(self, *args, **kwargs):
    """Traverse the entire puzzle tree and classifiers all the 
    positions with values and remoteness
    - If position already exists in memory, returns its value
    """        
    solutions, queue = self.puzzle.generateSolutions(), q.Queue()
    for solution in solutions: 
        self.remoteness[hash(solution)] = 0
        queue.put(solution)

    # BFS for remoteness classification                        
    while not queue.empty():
        puzzle = queue.get()
        for move in puzzle.generateMoves('undo'):
            nextPuzzle = puzzle.doMove(move)
            if hash(nextPuzzle) not in self.remoteness:
                self.remoteness[hash(nextPuzzle)] = self.remoteness[hash(puzzle)] + 1
                queue.put(nextPuzzle)
```

### Execute
Once you have implemented all the required functions, change the last line of the Python file outside of the class to:
```python
puzzle = Hanoi()
PuzzlePlayer(puzzle, solver=GeneralSolver(puzzle)).play()
```
On your CLI, execute
```bash
python <your_python_file_name>.py
```
If you have a Solver value of SOLVABLE, congrats! You have successfully implemented a BFS Solver!

## Extras
Ponder on these questions in how we can optimize this solver
- Try thinking of a way to optimize the algorithm for this solver.
- Are there any ways we can solve this not through BFS?
- This solver will not save the positions it classifies after execution is over. Think about ways we can add persistance to our solvers.
